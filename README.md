# Pancakeswap Prediction Mirror Bot

Join our community: https://t.me/drfurrbots

When you've lost all hope and want to put your luck in someone else's hands. This bot will mirror the bets of the wallet address set in the WALLET_TO_TRACK variable. A good place to find wallets is the leaderboard in Pancapeswap's Prediction platform. Find one thats active and on a hot streak.

## Usage

 With all of my bots you can find pre-compiled binaries in the dist folder. You should be able to run this bot anywhere (even mobile) without worrying about other dependencies.

1. rename env.example to .env
2. edit .env
3. pray

```
# Your wallet address
RECIPIENT=
# Your wallet's private key
PRIVATE_KEY=
# BSC node web socket address
BSC_NODE_WSS=wss://bsc-ws-node.nariox.org:443

BET_AMOUNT="0.01"

WALLET_TO_TRACK=
```
